The problem this project aims to solve is the need for a robust and efficient method to authenticate digital images and protect them from unauthorized use. In the digital age, images are easily duplicated
and shared, leading to copyright infringement and misuse. A reliable solution is needed to embed information in images to prove their authenticity and ownership.

The proposed solution is to implement a watermarking technique based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to ensure digital image authentication and copyright protection. This technique involves the
insertion of hidden data (watermarks) into the frequency domain of an image using FFT. These watermarks are imperceptible to the human eye but can be detected and verified later to establish the
imageâ€™s authenticity and the copyright holder.
